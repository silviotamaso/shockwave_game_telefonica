# shockwave_game_telefonica

Game created and produced by me, using the software Macromedia Director, for the publishing agency ModemMedia PoppeTyson. Featured at the Telefonica Brazil website in 1999 (https://www.telefonica.com.br). It is a kind of manual of the company's products and services but also a memory game (like the classic Simon), as stated in the instructions - click END on the first screen to play.

Made in Lingo language (OOP), with Macromedia Director.

I am using Netscape Communicator 4.79 to test and play my shockwave games. To run shockwave content in 2023:

1) install Netscape on Windows (works also in Windows 11):
https://download.cnet.com/Netscape-Communicator-32-bit-Base-Install/3000-2356_4-10004411.html

2) install an old version of the Shockwave plugin, I am using version 8 (released in 2000):
https://archive.org/download/ShockwaveInstaller/Shockwave_Installer.exe

or

http://www.oldversion.com/windows/adobe-shockwave

This will recognize Netscape in your system and enable it to run shockwave.

3) drag and drop the "dcr" file into your Netscape (maybe it will be necessary to restart Netscape after plugin install). Or use the html file provided here with the dcr file. This html file has to be in the same folder of the ".dcr" for the game to run. Open the html with your shockwave already enabled Netscape 4.79 and play.
